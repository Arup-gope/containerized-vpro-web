# VProfile Project

## Overview

The VProfile Project is a web application developed to showcase my skills in Java, Maven, and Tomcat. It incorporates various technologies such as MySQL, Memcached, and RabbitMQ for data storage and messaging.

## Project Architecture
The VPro web application project employs Java, Maven, MySQL, Memcached, RabbitMQ, and Tomcat for its architecture. Java forms the core of the application's logic, while Maven streamlines the development process. MySQL handles data storage, and Memcached optimizes data retrieval. RabbitMQ facilitates asynchronous communication, enhancing the application's responsiveness. Tomcat serves as the web server, handling HTTP requests.

To ensure consistent and manageable deployment, the project utilizes Docker. Three Dockerfiles are created for web, app, and DB components, allowing for isolated and efficient containerization. Docker Compose orchestrates these containers for streamlined management. Once the project is successfully deployed, it's pushed to DockerHub, ensuring easy future use and distribution across different environments. This architecture emphasizes performance, scalability, and simplicity in deployment.

## Features

- Built using Java and Maven.
- Utilizes the Tomcat web server for application deployment.
- Manages data storage through a MySQL database.
- Implements Redis for caching and data retrieval optimization.
- Used Memcached to cache the database
- Utilizes RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging.

## How to Run

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:


2. Navigate to the project directory:


3. Build the project using Maven:


4. Deploy the application to Tomcat:

- Copy the generated WAR file (e.g., `vprofile-v2.war`) to Tomcat's webapps directory.

5. Start the Tomcat server.

6. Access the application in your web browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and components:

- `/Docker-files`: Contains Docker configuration files for different services (database, app, web).
- `/src`: Java source code and application logic.
- `/web`: Web content and frontend components.
